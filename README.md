This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Groovy related to unexpected type coercion within a simple method. The `myMethod` function aims to return the larger of two numbers. However, due to Groovy's flexible typing, it behaves unexpectedly when input types are different. This can cause the method to return an incorrect value. The solution shows how to explicitly define the method parameters to ensure correct behavior.
